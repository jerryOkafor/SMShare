./gradlew :server:run
```

Open: `http://0.0.0.0:8080/` or `http://localhost:8080/`  to see the response from the server.

To access server from your Android device, run `adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080` and then access the
app on `http://<PC IP>:8080/`

##### Using Docker

```bash
./gradlew buildImage
```

##### Load image into docker

```bash
docker load < build/jib-image.tar
```

#### Testing Locally from your phone, run the following command:

##### Android
